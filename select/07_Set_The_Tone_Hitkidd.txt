(Hitkidd, what it do, man?)
A-L-E-Z-A
See, I'll break a nigga pockets 'fore I let him break my heart
And these bitches ain't on shit, do all that talkin' 'til I spark
Quick to sell his ass a dream like I'm lucid in the dark
I walked in with pressure on me, building smellin' like some fart
And I got hella niggas, I can't pick, they make it hard
All my opps wanna squash beef, but they done took that shit too far
He just asked me did I love him
Bitch, you must be gone off bars
I just stuffed my 'Wood with 'za, it got me tweakin', I'm on Mars

All that braggin' 'bout that nigga got that nigga fucked
Told that ho listen to Lil Durk, 'cause, ho, you should've ducked
And I ain't comin' off that nigga 'less he wipe his face
And I ain't doin' no wifey shit because I know my place
Yeah, I got bitches mad 'cause they facecard can't pull niggas
Let me call my nigga, just know Rambo gon' pull triggers
If I see your nigga, that's on your life, you won't get him back
Make him bend me over, make him eat this pussy from the back
(GloRilla!)

Dropped my last nigga and stopped fuckin' with his big homie
Runnin' through these niggas, Lori Harvey ain't got shit on me
I know them bitches watchin', I look like a fuckin' lick, don't it?
Talkin' 'bout me to that nigga
Bet he know that I'm the shit, don't he?
Money can't buy love, but it can buy me that new 'Vette, though
My pockets large, I'm eatin' good, I'm feelin' like a fat ho
Not steppin' on no toes because I'm at these bitches' neck, ho
Wonder why he love my lil' ass 'cause he know this pussy fat, ho

What you lookin' for?
You know I'm heat, I'm cookin', ho
Tryna shut me out, motherfucker, I'ma kick the door
I got the sauce, come lick it, ho
Fine as fuck, no ticket, ho
I be with the gang, yeah, we bang
I don't clique with hoes
It's the queen of the slimes
Queen of the dimes
You know I walk in the spot
Don't wait in no lines
Niggas broke than a motherfucker wastin' my time
I be laughin' at hoes, they really be tryin'
I got all my haters watchin'
Now's the time for you to clock in
Niggas don't want smoke
I call my bro, go get your Glock then (It's Carbon, bitch)
Bitch, we run the city
Fuck these niggas, man, we top ten
Burst a bitch bubble 'cause these hoes know I'm poppin'

Bitches in my business
Can you rappers sell bundles?
Ho, you better watch that nigga
'Fore I make you come up off him
He only a dog to you
I put him on a leash and walk him
Said I gon' stop shittin' on bitches 'cause I do it way too often
Put me on any beat, challenge me, bitches can't fuck with me
Lyrically, I'm a beast, on my gang, that's on CGE
You bitches play
I drop a bag, them members active in the street
I like niggas with fire head
When he done, I'm goin' straight to sleep
I like niggas with big bread, make a twenty, you can match that
We can't get caught textin'
So just hit me through your Snapchat
Opps can't get caught lackin'
We put 'em behind a hashtag
Thinkin' that I like, I'm tryna find out where his stash at

Y'all know what the fuck goin' on
Whole lotta Glitter Gang shit
Glorilla, bitch
A-L-E-Z-A
K Carbon, fuck y'all thought?
Ayy, they got us fucked up
Bitches got me fucked up
Niggas got me fucked up too
Hell nah
I wanna know how that shit sound
Play that shit back, Allie
