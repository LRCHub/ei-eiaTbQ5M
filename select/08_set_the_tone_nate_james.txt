I can't handle it, it's just taking too long
Had enough of it, decisions made I'm gone
See your struggling, your suffering
But I'm through with it, no more to do with it

See I dont wanna come across as the incesitve type, no
But the truth be known I'm lost, all my patience you have tried (yeah)
I Lost all sense of time, you caused this mix up in my mind
You've tired me out, I'm feeling strung out, yeah

Baby I'll set the tone
Made me step out of this on my own
Acting like nothings wrong
Needed time out to just be alone
Understand you don't own this man
Baby I'll set the tone, yeah

Not one part of me
Is feeling neglected
Come to think of it
A lot of time wasted
All that worry, voer nothing
Now I'm free of it, thats why I've ended it

See I dont wanna come across as the insensitve type, no
But the truth be known I'm lost, all my patience you have tried (yeah)
Lost all sense of time, you caused this mix up in my mind
You've tired me out, I'm feeling strung out, Oh

Baby I'll set the tone (Set the tone)
Made me step out of this on my own (oooh)

Acting like nothings wrong (hey)
Needed time out to just be alone
Understand (Understand) you don't own this man (Dont own this man)
Baby I'll set the tone, yeah

Dont think I'm wrapped around your finger
Back then was so naive to see just
What went on behind my back
What would've carried on like that
Did I deserve to be treated like the enemy

Baby I'll set the tone (I'll set it)
Made me step out of this on my own
Acting like nothings wrong (hey yea hey)
Needed time out to just be alone
Understand you don't own this man (you dont own this man)
Baby I'll set the tone, yeah (I'll set the tone yeah)

Baby I'll set the tone (ooh)
Made me step out of this on my own (yeeah)
Acting like nothings wrong
Needed time out to just be alone
Understand (Gotta take that time out) you don't own this man
Baby I'll set the tone, yeah (I'll set the tone girl)

Baby I'll set the tone
Made me step out of this on my own
Acting like nothings wrong (yeeh)
Needed time out to just be alone
Understand (oooh) you don't own this man (oooh)
Baby I'll set the tone, yeah
